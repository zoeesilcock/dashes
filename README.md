# Dashes
Configuration files for generating .docset files for Dash using
[dashing](https://github.com/technosophos/dashing). These are for personal use
and as I won't have time to maintain them I will not be contributing them to
the user contributed docset repository but perhaps someone will find it useful.

## Usage
After downloading the documentation place the icon and dashing.json files in
the root of the documentation folder. Next run `dashing build [name]` where
[name] is the approriate entry from the list below.
